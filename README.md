# debianpaste-clients

debianpaste-clients is a Python client for [Debian Pastezone](https://paste.debian.net). Originally built by Micheal Gebetsroither, forked by me to bring it forward.

The original code is included as `old-paste.py`, or in the [gebi/debianpaste-clients](https://github.com/gebi/debianpaste-clients) repository. For a full list of changes, please refer to the [list of commits](https://github.com/bvanrijn/debianpaste-clients/commits).
